# Event loops and the asynchronous programming in Javascript
This STS is based on the importance of Asynchronous programming in Javascript and how Javascript actually works, how it executes callbacks and handles asynchronous code. It will also cover how to use Callbacks, Promises and Async Await effectively in your code. This session will also cover little bit about the concept of Generators in javaScript.

## Introduction
ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Here are some important points to remember:

* Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code. Previous options for asynchronous code are callbacks and promises.
* Async/await is actually built on top of promises. It cannot be used with plain callbacks or node callbacks.
* Async/await is, like promises, non blocking.
* Async/await makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This is where all its power lies.

## WHY Aysnc Await ?

* Concise and clean.
* Handles both synchronous and asynchronous errors with the same construct.
* Conditionals - helps in making multiple requests.
* Last but not least, a killer advantage when using async/await is that itâ€™s much easier to debug
* Async/Await was created to simplify the process of working with and writing chained promises.
* And so on...
