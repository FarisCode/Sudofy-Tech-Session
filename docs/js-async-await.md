## Introduction
ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Here are some important points to remember:
* Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code. Previous options for asynchronous code are callbacks and promises.
* Async/await is actually built on top of promises. It cannot be used with plain callbacks or node callbacks.
* Async/await is, like promises, non blocking.
* Async/await makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This is where all its power lies.
