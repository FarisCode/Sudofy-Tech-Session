## Introduction
ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Here are some important points to remember:

* Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code. Previous options for asynchronous code are callbacks and promises.
* Async/await is actually built on top of promises. It cannot be used with plain callbacks or node callbacks.
* Async/await is, like promises, non blocking.
* Async/await makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This is where all its power lies.

## WHY Aysnc Await ?

* Concise and clean.
* Handles both synchronous and asynchronous errors with the same construct.
* Conditionals - helps in making multiple requests.
* Last but not least, a killer advantage when using async/await is that itâ€™s much easier to debug
* And so on...
