# AWS Intro Session
In this session we are going to discuss about AWS and its basic services and use cases

## What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computings)

## Six benefits of moving to AWS cloud

### Trade capital expense for variable expense
Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

### Benefit from massive economies of scale
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

### Stop guessing about capacity
Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

### Increase speed and agility
In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

### Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

### Go global in minutes
Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

## Scaling Infrastructure

### Traditional Infrastructure

Traditional Infrastructure is not scale able at all, You can surely provision more and more servers to your data center but its really hard to estimate the server required for a healthy infrastructure. even if you are able to estimate your usage you would end up with a lot of un utilized resources in your data center

### AWS Infrastructure with auto scaling
